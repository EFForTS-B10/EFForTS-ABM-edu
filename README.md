# Educational versions of the EfforTS-ABM model

This repository is a public copy of the edu branch from the EFForTS-ABM repository. 
It contains versions of the EFForTS-ABM model with a simplified GUI that can be used for educational purposes.  

**EFForTS-ABM-edu-scenarios.nlogo**   
- for Bachelor/Master courses  
- allows to run simulations from Dislich 2018  

**EFForTS-ABM-edu-NoS-english/german.nlogo**  
- for a non-scientific audience (e.g. Night of Science)  
- allows to compare farmers' wealth with (theoretical) costs of CO2 emissions  

All three educational versions rely on the same source code.  

At the moment, the xw-extension, which is used to create an extra parameter tab, does not work with NetLogo>=6.2.0. It is recommended to use NetLogo==6.1.1.
